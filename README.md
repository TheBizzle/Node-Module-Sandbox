This project is unlikely to have any benefit for anyone but me.  Unless you are me, I suggest that you stop wasting your time looking at this soon/now.

If you're still here... the `master` branch contains an almost-working configuration for building a snapshot of the ClowCards CoffeeScript code with RequireJS.  For some reason, the version of jQuery that comes through Node doesn't work properly for this, but I don't actually care enough to fix it in this project; the one that matters is ClowCards.

The `browserify` branch, on the other hand, contains an almost-working configuration that utilizes Browserify.   I have no desire to figure out how to shim jQuery in properly with Browserify.

I mostly just did this to learn about Grunt, RequireJS, and Browserifyâ€”not to battle with these foreign tools enough and creating a working product.  So...  my learning here is done:
